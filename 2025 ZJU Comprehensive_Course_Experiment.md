### **Why did we choose this topic?**

Sustainable development is a shared global strategic objective, yet heavy reliance on fossil fuels jeopardizes long-term environmental stability. Energy sits at the heart of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), intersecting with climate change, energy security, and economic growth. However, public understanding of the link between energy use and carbon emissions remains limited, particularly in fast-growing economies. Visualization—through intuitive charts and data—helps non-specialist audiences grasp the current state, trends, and urgency of global carbon emissions. This report unfolds in seven sections, progressively revealing the relationships among energy consumption, carbon emissions, and economic development, with a spotlight on China’s role and its global impact.

### **Data-processing approach:**

  A Python script built with pandas is used to ingest and cleanse the large, granular dataset. The pivot function is then applied to reshape the table so that sectors become columns (or indices) and countries/years become rows (or columns), facilitating subsequent visualization.

### **Visualization Guide**

**Recommended Visualization Software:** Tableau

**Chart Types:** Pie Chart, Line Chart, Scatter Plot.
